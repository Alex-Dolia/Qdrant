Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks, explanations, or additional text before or after the list.\n3.  **Completion Signal:** Output `<|COMPLETE|>` as the final line after all relevant entities and relationships have been extracted and presented.\n4.  **Output Language:** Ensure the output language is English. Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) must be kept in their original language and not translated.\n\n<Output>\n---Role---\nYou are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.\n    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity. If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line.

Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty.

SUBSTITUTE \n\n4.1 As at the date of entry into this agreement, the intention is for the Consultancy to provide the Services through the Consultancy Personnel. However, the Consultancy may, if the Consultancy Personnel is unable to provide the Services for any reason, provide the Services through another person engaged by the Consultancy (\"Substitute\") provided that the Substitute is suitably qualified and has the appropriate skills and experience. The Consultancy shall inform the Agency of the identity and qualification of any Substitute which the Consultancy proposes to use to provide the Services. \n\nWhere the Consultancy provides a Substitute pursuant to clause 4.1 above, the 4.2 Consultancy shall be responsible for paying such Substitute and shall ensure that any agreement between the Consultancy and any Substitute contains obligations which correspond to the obligations of the Consultancy under the terms of this agreement. The Consultancy shall remain responsible for the acts or omissions of any Substitute. \n\nThe Consultancy shall take all reasonable steps to avoid any unplanned changes of 4.3 Consultancy Personnel assigned to the performance of the Services. However, if the Consultancy is unable for any reason to perform the Services the Consultancy should inform the Client on the first day of unavailability and shall provide a Substitute in accordance with the provisions of clause 4.1. \n\n5. INVOICING - SELF -BILLING \n\n5.1 This agreement incorporates a self-billing arrangement between the Agency and the Consultancy. 1PS Limited (\"1PS\"), acting for the Agency, will prepare the Consultancy's invoice for the Services provided to the Client and will send payment of the amount of the due to the Consultancy in accordance with clause 6. Invoices will be raised in the frequency as agreed for the Placement. \n\n3   \n5.2 The Consultancy agrees:   \nto the self-billing arrangement and to accept invoices raised on the   \n5.2.1 Consultancy's behalf by the Agency (or 1PS, acting for the Agency) subject to Clause 6;   \n5.2.2 not to raise separate VAT invoices for services covered by the self\n\nbilling arrangement; \n\n5.2.3 that the contract will be produced to HM Revenue & Customs (\"HMRC\") if the Consultancy is asked to provide a copy by HMRC; \n\n5.2.4 to inform the Agency and 1PS immediately if the Consultancy (1) ceases to be registered for VAT; (2) transfers or sells their business as a going concern; or \n\n(3) changes their VAT number; and \n\n5.2.5 that the Agency remains solely liable for the payment of any debt due for services performed by the Consultancy and that 1PS, or any other third party to whom the self-billing arrangement is outsourced, will not have any liability under this contract for any debt due by the Agency to the Consultancy. \n\n5.3 The Agency agrees: \n\n5.3.1 that it (or 1PS acting on its behalf) will issue self-billed invoices for the Services performed by the Consultancy under this agreement; \n\n5.3.2 to complete the self-billed invoices showing the Consultancy's name, address and VAT registration number, together with all the other details which constitute a full VAT invoice; \n\n5.3.3 to enter into a new self-billing agreement in the event that the Consultancy's VAT registration number changes; and \n\n5.3.4 to inform the Consultancy if (1) this self-billing arrangement is to be terminated; (2) the outsourcing of this self-billing arrangement to 1PS is terminated; or (3) the issue of self-billed invoices will be outsourced to another third party. \n\n5.4 The Agency shall not be obliged to pay any Fee to the Consultancy unless an invoice has been properly submitted by the Consultancy in accordance with sub-clause 5.2 of this agreement and until the Client has verified the execution of the Services. \n\n6. FEES \n\nIn consideration of the Consultancy providing the Services in accordance with clause 3, the 6.1 Agency agrees to pay the Consultancy the consultancy fees and any expenses set out for the Placement, with any value added tax applicable, payable at the prevailing rate if applicable. \n\n6.2 The Fees shall accrue from day to day (business days only to be included) during the month in which the Services are provided and be payable as per the payment terms agreed for the Placement by way of bank transfer. Payment of the Fees shall be made directly to the Consultancy on the Friday following the production of the invoice pursuant to clause 5. \n\n6.3 If it has been agreed that the Consultant will be able to recover expenses under this agreement (as per the Placement hereto), such expenses will only be payable if the Client has approved the expenses in advance within the 1PS portal (or other method agreed) and provided that the Consultancy is able to produce such receipts or other evidence as the Agency may require. For the avoidance of doubt, payment of any such expenses will be made in accordance with clause 6.2 and will be limited to the amount of any out-of-pocket expenses properly incurred in the provision of the Services under this agreement. In addition, payment of approved expenses will be made as per the terms agreed with the agency. This may be on a ‘paid when paid’ basis. \n\n6.4 The Agency shall be entitled to deduct from the Fees any sum that the Consultancy (or the Consultancy Personnel or any Substitute) may owe to the Agency at\n```",

If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line.

Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty.

They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands.

SUBSTITUTE \n\n4.1 As at the date of entry into this agreement, the intention is for the Consultancy to provide the Services through the Consultancy Personnel. However, the Consultancy may, if the Consultancy Personnel is unable to provide the Services for any reason, provide the Services through another person engaged by the Consultancy (\"Substitute\") provided that the Substitute is suitably qualified and has the appropriate skills and experience. The Consultancy shall inform the Agency of the identity and qualification of any Substitute which the Consultancy proposes to use to provide the Services. \n\nWhere the Consultancy provides a Substitute pursuant to clause 4.1 above, the 4.2 Consultancy shall be responsible for paying such Substitute and shall ensure that any agreement between the Consultancy and any Substitute contains obligations which correspond to the obligations of the Consultancy under the terms of this agreement. The Consultancy shall remain responsible for the acts or omissions of any Substitute. \n\nThe Consultancy shall take all reasonable steps to avoid any unplanned changes of 4.3 Consultancy Personnel assigned to the performance of the Services. However, if the Consultancy is unable for any reason to perform the Services the Consultancy should inform the Client on the first day of unavailability and shall provide a Substitute in accordance with the provisions of clause 4.1. \n\n5. INVOICING - SELF -BILLING \n\n5.1 This agreement incorporates a self-billing arrangement between the Agency and the Consultancy. 1PS Limited (\"1PS\"), acting for the Agency, will prepare the Consultancy's invoice for the Services provided to the Client and will send payment of the amount of the due to the Consultancy in accordance with clause 6. Invoices will be raised in the frequency as agreed for the Placement. \n\n3   \n5.2 The Consultancy agrees:   \nto the self-billing arrangement and to accept invoices raised on the   \n5.2.1 Consultancy's behalf by the Agency (or 1PS, acting for the Agency) subject to Clause 6;   \n5.2.2 not to raise separate VAT invoices for services covered by the self\n\nbilling arrangement; \n\n5.2.3 that the contract will be produced to HM Revenue & Customs (\"HMRC\") if the Consultancy is asked to provide a copy by HMRC; \n\n5.2.4 to inform the Agency and 1PS immediately if the Consultancy (1) ceases to be registered for VAT; (2) transfers or sells their business as a going concern; or \n\n(3) changes their VAT number; and \n\n5.2.5 that the Agency remains solely liable for the payment of any debt due for services performed by the Consultancy and that 1PS, or any other third party to whom the self-billing arrangement is outsourced, will not have any liability under this contract for any debt due by the Agency to the Consultancy. \n\n5.3 The Agency agrees: \n\n5.3.1 that it (or 1PS acting on its behalf) will issue self-billed invoices for the Services performed by the Consultancy under this agreement; \n\n5.3.2 to complete the self-billed invoices showing the Consultancy's name, address and VAT registration number, together with all the other details which constitute a full VAT invoice; \n\n5.3.3 to enter into a new self-billing agreement in the event that the Consultancy's VAT registration number changes; and \n\n5.3.4 to inform the Consultancy if (1) this self-billing arrangement is to be terminated; (2) the outsourcing of this self-billing arrangement to 1PS is terminated; or (3) the issue of self-billed invoices will be outsourced to another third party. \n\n5.4 The Agency shall not be obliged to pay any Fee to the Consultancy unless an invoice has been properly submitted by the Consultancy in accordance with sub-clause 5.2 of this agreement and until the Client has verified the execution of the Services. \n\n6. FEES \n\nIn consideration of the Consultancy providing the Services in accordance with clause 3, the 6.1 Agency agrees to pay the Consultancy the consultancy fees and any expenses set out for the Placement, with any value added tax applicable, payable at the prevailing rate if applicable. \n\n6.2 The Fees shall accrue from day to day (business days only to be included) during the month in which the Services are provided and be payable as per the payment terms agreed for the Placement by way of bank transfer. Payment of the Fees shall be made directly to the Consultancy on the Friday following the production of the invoice pursuant to clause 5. \n\n6.3 If it has been agreed that the Consultant will be able to recover expenses under this agreement (as per the Placement hereto), such expenses will only be payable if the Client has approved the expenses in advance within the 1PS portal (or other method agreed) and provided that the Consultancy is able to produce such receipts or other evidence as the Agency may require. For the avoidance of doubt, payment of any such expenses will be made in accordance with clause 6.2 and will be limited to the amount of any out-of-pocket expenses properly incurred in the provision of the Services under this agreement. In addition, payment of approved expenses will be made as per the terms agreed with the agency. This may be on a ‘paid when paid’ basis. \n\n6.4 The Agency shall be entitled to deduct from the Fees any sum that the Consultancy (or the Consultancy Personnel or any Substitute) may owe to the Agency at\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line.

Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

It takes three arguments: `text`, `old_text`, and `[new_text]`.\n\n**Syntax**\n\n=SUBSTITUTE(text, old_text, [new_text])\n\n* `text`: The text in which you want to find and replace the old text.\n* `old_text`: The text that you want to replace.\n* `[new_text]`: (optional) The new text that you want to substitute for the old text.\n\n**How it Works**\n\nThe `SUBSTITUTE` function searches for the first occurrence of `old_text` in `text`, and replaces it with `new_text`. If `new_text` is not specified, it will be replaced with a blank string (i.e., an empty space).\n\n**Examples**\n\n* `=SUBSTITUTE(\"Hello world\", \"world\", \"Universe\")` returns `\"Hello Universe\"`\n* `=SUBSTITUTE(\"My name is John\", \"John\", \"Jane\")` returns `\"My name is Jane\"`\n* `=SUBSTITUTE(\"This is a test string\", \"test\", \"\")` returns `\"This is a  string\"`\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n\n* To replace all occurrences of `old_text`, use the `REPLACE` function instead.\n* To replace text with a specified number of characters, use the `MID` function to extract the text to be replaced, and then use `SUBSTITUTE` on that extracted text.",
