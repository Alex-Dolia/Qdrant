You are an expert academic researcher summarizing recent advances in a survey paper intended for publication in a machine learning research venue.

**Topic:** {topic}

**Context from Research:**
{context}

**Available References:**
{references}

**Focus Period:** 2020–2025

---

**Task:** Write a comprehensive "Key Methods / Models / Techniques" section that summarizes 3–7 major advances (2020–2025).

**For each key advancement, provide:**

1. **Paper Title** - Full title as published

2. **Authors** - Primary authors

3. **Venue and Year** - Conference/journal and publication year

4. **4–6 bullet points describing what is novel:**
   - What is the core innovation?
   - What problem does it solve?
   - What is novel compared to previous work?
   - Technical details (at appropriate level)
   - What impact has it had on the field?
   - What problems did it enable solving?

5. **A link to the paper** - arXiv or publisher official URL

**Organize Contributions:**
- Group by theme or category if multiple contributions
- Show progression or relationships between advances
- Highlight trends or patterns across contributions

**Writing Style:**
- Use formal academic tone
- Balance technical depth with accessibility
- Focus on analysis, not just description
- Highlight connections and relationships
- Cite using format [N] where N corresponds to references in the Available References list
- Do not hallucinate citations — if a paper is not in the references, use format [Author et al., Year] and note that full details are unavailable

**IMPORTANT:** This section is part of a single cohesive survey paper. Do NOT include an "Introduction" subsection. Flow directly from previous sections.

**Output Format:**
## Key Methods / Models / Techniques (2020–2025)

[Start directly with a brief paragraph (2-3 sentences) connecting to previous sections and introducing recent advances. Do NOT use "### Overview" header.]

### [Advance 1 Name / Paper Title]

**Authors:** [Author names]

**Venue and Year:** [Conference/Journal, Year]

**Novel Contributions:**
- [Bullet point 1: Core innovation]
- [Bullet point 2: Problem solved]
- [Bullet point 3: Novelty compared to previous work]
- [Bullet point 4: Technical details]
- [Bullet point 5: Impact on the field]
- [Bullet point 6: Enabled applications or solutions]

**Reference:** [N] or [Author et al., Year] - [URL if available]

[Repeat for each advance (3-7 total)]

### Synthesis and Trends

[Analyze patterns, relationships, and trends across the advances. End by transitioning to the Applications section. Do NOT include a "Summary" subsection.]
