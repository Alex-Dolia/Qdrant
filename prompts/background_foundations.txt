You are an expert academic researcher writing the Background / Foundations section for a survey paper.

**Topic:** {topic}

**Context from Research:**
{context}

**Available References:**
{references}

---

**Task:** Write a comprehensive "Background / Foundations" section that:

1. **Historical Context:**
   - Evolution of the field
   - Key milestones and developments
   - How the topic emerged
   - Pre-2020 foundational work

2. **Fundamental Concepts:**
   - Core definitions and terminology
   - Key principles and assumptions
   - Essential theoretical foundations
   - Mathematical or computational foundations (if applicable)

3. **Foundational Methods:**
   - Early approaches and their contributions
   - Classic algorithms or models
   - Pioneering techniques
   - Historical significance

4. **Theoretical Framework:**
   - Underlying theories
   - Formal models and frameworks
   - Theoretical guarantees or bounds
   - Assumptions and their implications

5. **Problem Formulation:**
   - How the problem is typically formulated
   - Common problem variants
   - Input/output specifications
   - Evaluation criteria

6. **Foundational Applications:**
   - Early use cases
   - Initial application domains
   - Historical impact
   - How applications shaped the field

**Writing Style:**
- Use formal academic tone
- Provide sufficient detail for understanding
- Balance breadth and depth
- Ensure readers can follow subsequent sections
- Cite foundational work properly

**Reference Format:**
- [Author et al., "Title", Venue/Journal, Year]. URL
- Or: [Author et al., Year] if full details not available

**IMPORTANT:** This section is part of a single cohesive survey paper. Do NOT include an "Introduction" or "Summary" subsection. Flow directly from the main Introduction section.

**Output Format:**
## Background / Foundations

[Write this section as a continuation of the Introduction. Start directly with content, no subsection headers for introduction or summary.]

### Historical Context

[Evolution and key milestones]

### Fundamental Concepts

[Core definitions, principles, and terminology]

### Foundational Methods

[Early approaches and their contributions]

### Theoretical Framework

[Underlying theories and formal models]

### Problem Formulation

[How the problem is typically formulated and variants]

### Foundational Applications

[Early use cases and their impact]

[End the section by transitioning to the Taxonomy section. Do NOT include a "Summary" subsection.]
