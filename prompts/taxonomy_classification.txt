You are an expert academic researcher developing a taxonomy and classification scheme for organizing research methods in a survey paper intended for publication in a machine learning research venue.

**Topic:** {topic}

**Context from Research:**
{context}

**Available References:**
{references}

---

**Task:** Create a comprehensive Taxonomy / Classification Scheme section that provides a structured breakdown (e.g., **method type**, **training regime**, **data modality**, or **interpretability mechanism**).

**Requirements:**

1. **Propose Meaningful Categories:**
   - Identify 3–5 major categories for organizing existing methods
   - Categories should be:
     - Mutually exclusive (methods belong to one category)
     - Collectively exhaustive (all methods fit somewhere)
     - Theoretically grounded (based on meaningful distinctions)
     - Practically useful (help readers understand the landscape)
   - Your structure must be logically justified

2. **Explain Grouping Criteria:**
   - For each category, explain:
     - What is the defining characteristic?
     - What distinguishes this category from others?
     - What are the underlying principles or assumptions?
     - What are the advantages and limitations of this approach?

3. **Provide Examples:**
   - For each category, provide:
     - At least one concrete example method/model
     - Brief explanation of why it fits this category
     - Key characteristics that exemplify the category
     - Reference: Cite using format [N] where N corresponds to references in the Available References list

4. **Include a Table if Helpful:**
   - Create a classification table showing:
     - Categories as rows or columns
     - Key characteristics as columns or rows
     - Example methods in cells
   - Use markdown table format

5. **Visual Organization:**
   - Explain how categories relate to each other
   - Identify any hierarchical relationships
   - Note any overlapping or hybrid approaches

**Common Classification Dimensions (use as inspiration, not limitation):**
- **Methodological approach:** Supervised vs. unsupervised vs. semi-supervised
- **Architectural design:** Model-based vs. data-driven vs. hybrid
- **Problem formulation:** Classification vs. generation vs. retrieval
- **Application domain:** NLP vs. vision vs. multimodal
- **Learning paradigm:** End-to-end vs. pipeline vs. modular
- **Theoretical foundation:** Statistical vs. neural vs. symbolic
- **Training regime:** Pre-training vs. fine-tuning vs. few-shot
- **Data modality:** Text vs. image vs. multimodal

**Writing Style:**
- Use formal academic tone
- Be systematic and clear
- Use tables or structured lists if helpful
- Ensure logical flow and coherence
- Cite all examples with proper references [N]
- Justify your classification scheme clearly

**IMPORTANT:** This section is part of a single cohesive survey paper. Do NOT include an "Introduction" or "Summary" subsection. Flow directly from the Background section.

**Output Format:**
## Taxonomy / Classification of Approaches

[Start directly with content connecting to the Background section. Do NOT use "### Introduction" header.]

### Classification Rationale

[Explain the overall approach to classification, why these categories are meaningful, and how the structure is logically justified]

### Classification Table (Optional but Recommended)

| Category | Defining Characteristic | Key Methods | Advantages | Limitations |
|----------|------------------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| [Category 1] | [Characteristic] | [Methods] | [Advantages] | [Limitations] |
| [Category 2] | [Characteristic] | [Methods] | [Advantages] | [Limitations] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Category 1: [Category Name]

**Defining Characteristics:**
[What makes this category distinct]

**Key Methods:**
- [Method 1]: [Brief description] [Reference [N]]
- [Method 2]: [Brief description] [Reference [N]]

**Advantages and Limitations:**
[Analysis of this category's strengths and weaknesses]

[Repeat for each category]

### Relationships Between Categories

[Explain how categories relate, any hierarchies, overlaps, or hybrid approaches. End by transitioning to the Recent Advances section. Do NOT include a "Summary" subsection.]
