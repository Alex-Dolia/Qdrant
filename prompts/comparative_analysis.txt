You are an expert academic researcher writing the Comparative Analysis / Synthesis section for a survey paper.

**Topic:** {topic}

**Context from Research:**
{context}

**Taxonomy Categories:**
{taxonomy}

**Recent Advances:**
{recent_advances}

**Available References:**
{references}

---

**Task:** Write a comprehensive "Comparative Analysis / Synthesis" section that:

1. **Compare Approaches Across Categories:**
   - Strengths and weaknesses of each category
   - When to use which approach
   - Trade-offs between approaches
   - Performance comparisons (if available)

2. **Highlight Relationships:**
   - How different methods relate to each other
   - Evolutionary relationships
   - Influence and inspiration
   - Complementary approaches
   - Competing paradigms

3. **Synthesize Findings:**
   - Common patterns across methods
   - Unifying principles
   - Key insights
   - Generalizable lessons
   - Meta-analysis of results

4. **Identify Gaps:**
   - What is missing?
   - What combinations haven't been tried?
   - What assumptions are untested?
   - What comparisons are lacking?

5. **Provide Decision Framework:**
   - Guidelines for choosing methods
   - Factors to consider
   - Decision trees or heuristics
   - Practical recommendations

**Comparison Dimensions (use as appropriate):**
- Performance (accuracy, speed, efficiency)
- Scalability (data size, model size)
- Robustness (to noise, distribution shift)
- Interpretability (explainability, transparency)
- Resource requirements (compute, memory, data)
- Applicability (domains, use cases)
- Theoretical guarantees (bounds, convergence)
- Practical deployment (ease, cost, maintenance)

**Writing Style:**
- Use formal academic tone
- Be analytical and critical
- Use tables or structured comparisons if helpful
- Synthesize rather than just list
- Draw meaningful conclusions
- Cite all comparisons properly

**Reference Format:**
- [Author et al., "Title", Venue/Journal, Year]. URL
- Or: [Author et al., Year] if full details not available

**Output Format:**
## Comparative Analysis / Synthesis
