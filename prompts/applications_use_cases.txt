You are an expert academic researcher writing the Applications and Use Cases section for a survey paper.

**Topic:** {topic}

**Context from Research:**
{context}

**Available References:**
{references}

---

**Task:** Write a comprehensive "Applications and Use Cases" section that:

1. **Categorize Applications:**
   - Organize by domain (e.g., healthcare, finance, education)
   - Or by problem type (e.g., classification, generation, retrieval)
   - Or by scale (e.g., personal, enterprise, research)

2. **For Each Application Category, Provide:**

   a. **Domain/Problem Description:**
      - What is the application domain?
      - What problems does it address?
      - Why is this topic relevant here?
   
   b. **Specific Use Cases:**
      - Concrete examples of applications
      - Real-world scenarios
      - Practical implementations
      - Case studies (if available)
   
   c. **Methodological Approaches:**
      - What methods from the taxonomy are used?
      - How are methods adapted for this domain?
      - What are the domain-specific considerations?
   
   d. **Results and Impact:**
      - Performance metrics or outcomes
      - Practical benefits
      - User impact
      - Business or societal value
   
   e. **Challenges and Limitations:**
      - Domain-specific challenges
      - Deployment issues
      - Scalability concerns
      - Ethical considerations

3. **Cross-Domain Patterns:**
   - Common patterns across applications
   - Reusable approaches
   - Transfer learning opportunities
   - Generalizable insights

4. **Emerging Applications:**
   - New or emerging use cases
   - Experimental applications
   - Future potential
   - Research opportunities

**Writing Style:**
- Use formal academic tone
- Balance general principles with specific examples
- Show practical relevance
- Connect to methods from taxonomy
- Cite application papers properly

**Reference Format:**
- [Author et al., "Title", Venue/Journal, Year]. URL
- Or: [Author et al., Year] if full details not available

**IMPORTANT:** This section is part of a single cohesive survey paper. Do NOT include an "Introduction" or "Summary" subsection. Flow directly from previous sections.

**Output Format:**
## Applications and Use Cases

[Start directly with a brief paragraph (2-3 sentences) connecting to previous sections and introducing applications. Do NOT use "### Introduction" header.]

### [Application Category 1]

**Domain Description:**
[What is this domain and why is it relevant]

**Use Cases:**
- [Use case 1]: [Description, methods used, results] [Reference]
- [Use case 2]: [Description, methods used, results] [Reference]

**Methodological Approaches:**
[How methods are adapted and applied]

**Results and Impact:**
[Performance, benefits, and value]

**Challenges:**
[Domain-specific challenges and limitations]

[Repeat for each category]

### Cross-Domain Patterns

[Common patterns and reusable approaches]

### Emerging Applications

[New use cases and future potential. End by transitioning to the Comparative Analysis section. Do NOT include a "Summary" subsection.]
