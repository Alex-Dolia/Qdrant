You are an expert academic researcher creating a comparative analysis table for a survey paper intended for publication in a machine learning research venue.

**Topic:** {topic}

**Context from Research:**
{context}

**Taxonomy Categories:**
{taxonomy}

**Recent Advances:**
{recent_advances}

**Available References:**
{references}

---

**Task:** Create a comprehensive "Comparative Analysis" section with a detailed comparison table.

**Table Requirements:**

1. **Columns should reflect meaningful evaluation dimensions:**
   - Scalability (data size, model size, computational requirements)
   - Data demands (amount, quality, labeling requirements)
   - Interpretability (explainability, transparency, understandability)
   - Sample efficiency (few-shot, zero-shot, data efficiency)
   - Latency (inference time, training time)
   - Deployment feasibility (ease of deployment, resource requirements)
   - Safety constraints (robustness, fairness, bias, security)
   - Performance (accuracy, F1, BLEU, or domain-specific metrics)
   - Theoretical guarantees (convergence, bounds, provable properties)
   - Applicability (domains, use cases, limitations)

2. **Rows should represent:**
   - Major methods/models from the taxonomy
   - Key approaches discussed in recent advances
   - Representative techniques from each category

3. **Cell Content:**
   - Use short, analytical commentary
   - Not general praise or vague claims
   - Specific, factual comparisons
   - Quantitative data when available (e.g., "Requires 100GB+ memory", "Achieves 95% accuracy on X dataset")
   - Relative comparisons (e.g., "Higher than Y but lower than Z")
   - Use symbols or abbreviations for brevity: ✓ (yes/strong), ✗ (no/weak), ~ (moderate), N/A (not applicable)

**Writing Style:**
- Use formal academic tone
- Be analytical and critical
- Support claims with citations [N] where N corresponds to references
- Avoid vague statements like "good performance" — specify what and how much
- Use precise terminology

**IMPORTANT:** This section is part of a single cohesive survey paper. Do NOT include an "Introduction" or "Summary" subsection. Flow directly from previous sections.

**Output Format:**
## Comparative Analysis

[Start directly with a brief paragraph (2-3 sentences) connecting to previous sections and introducing the comparative analysis. Do NOT use "### Introduction" header.]

### Comparative Analysis Table

| Method/Model | Scalability | Data Demands | Interpretability | Sample Efficiency | Latency | Deployment | Safety | Performance | Theoretical Guarantees | Applicability |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|---------|------------|--------|-------------|----------------------|---------------|
| [Method 1] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] |
| [Method 2] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] |
| [Method 3] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] | [Analysis] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Legend:**
- ✓ = Strong/Yes
- ✗ = Weak/No  
- ~ = Moderate
- N/A = Not Applicable

### Detailed Analysis

[Provide detailed commentary on key comparisons, patterns, and insights from the table]

### Key Insights

[Summarize main findings from the comparative analysis. End by transitioning to the Challenges section. Do NOT include a "Summary" subsection.]
