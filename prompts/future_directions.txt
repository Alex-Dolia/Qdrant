You are an expert academic researcher proposing future research directions in a survey paper.

**Topic:** {topic}

**Context from Research:**
{context}

**Identified Challenges:**
{challenges}

**Available References:**

**Task:** Write a comprehensive "Future Research Directions" section that:

1. **Base Recommendations on:**
   - Identified challenges and limitations
   - Gaps in current research
   - Emerging trends and patterns
   - Theoretical and practical needs
   - Interdisciplinary opportunities

2. **Provide Realistic and Insightful Directions:**

   a. **Short-term Directions (1–2 years):**
      - Immediate next steps
      - Incremental improvements
      - Low-hanging fruit
      - Quick wins
   
   b. **Medium-term Directions (3–5 years):**
      - Significant advances needed
      - Major research questions
      - Paradigm shifts
      - Cross-domain integration
   
   c. **Long-term Directions (5+ years):**
      - Visionary goals
      - Fundamental breakthroughs needed
      - Transformative applications
      - Grand challenges

3. **For Each Direction, Include:**
   - Clear description of the research direction
   - Why it is important and timely
   - What problems it would address
   - What challenges need to be overcome
   - Potential impact and applications
   - Connections to existing work

4. **Organize by Theme:**
   - Methodological improvements
   - Theoretical advances
   - Application domains
   - Interdisciplinary research
   - Infrastructure and tools
   - Evaluation and benchmarking

5. **Be Specific and Actionable:**
   - Avoid vague statements
   - Provide concrete research questions
   - Suggest methodological approaches
   - Identify key stakeholders
   - Note resource requirements

**Writing Style:**
- Use formal academic tone
- Be forward-looking but grounded
- Inspire without overpromising
- Connect to current state of the art
- Show how directions address identified challenges

**IMPORTANT:** This section is part of a single cohesive survey paper. Do NOT include an "Introduction" or "Summary" subsection. Flow directly from previous sections.

**Output Format:**
## Future Research Directions

[Start directly with a brief paragraph (2-3 sentences) connecting to previous sections and introducing future directions. Do NOT use "### Introduction" header.]

### Short-term Directions (1–2 years)

#### [Direction 1]

[Description, importance, challenges, potential impact]

#### [Direction 2]

[Description, importance, challenges, potential impact]

[Repeat for each short-term direction]

### Medium-term Directions (3–5 years)

#### [Direction 1]

[Description, importance, challenges, potential impact]

[Repeat for each medium-term direction]

### Long-term Directions (5+ years)

#### [Direction 1]

[Description, importance, challenges, potential impact]

[Repeat for each long-term direction]

### Interdisciplinary Opportunities

[Discussion of cross-domain research opportunities. End by transitioning to the Conclusion section. Do NOT include a "Summary" subsection.]
