       work (including, without limitation, any computer program), database, domain name, business
       name, trade mark or trade or brand name or get-up made, created, devised, developed or
       discovered by the Consultancy or the Consultancy Personnel or any Substitute (either alone or

       ("Client IPR") (including, without limitation, the right to apply for the same) to the Client to the
       fullest extent permitted by law. Insofar as any Client IPR does not vest in the Client
       automatically by operation of law or under this agreement, the Consultancy and/or
       Consultancy Personnel or Substitute holds legal title in such Client IPR on trust for the Client.

14.2   The Consultancy warrants to the Agency that it has obtained from the Consultancy Personnel
       a valid written assignment of all existing and future Client IPR of which the Consultancy
       Personnel or Substitute is the first owner and of all materials embodying such rights and a
       written irrevocable waiver of all the Consultancy Personnel's statutory moral rights in the
       Works, to the fullest extent permissible by law. The Consultancy shall provide to the Agency a
       copy of such assignment, as required, on or before the date of this agreement. In the event
       that any Substitute is appointed, the Consultancy shall, prior to the date on which such
       appointment becomes effective, obtain such an assignment from such Substitute and provide
       a copy of such assignment and agreement to the Consultancy.




                                                                                                        9
14.3   The Consultancy undertakes to the Agency that it will:

       14.3.1      notify to the Client in writing full details of all Works promptly on their creation,
                   devising, development or discovery;

       14.3.2      at termination of this agreement, or whenever requested to do so by the Client or
                   the Agency, will deliver all correspondence, documents, papers and records on all
                   media (and all copies or abstracts of them), recording or relating to any part of the
                   Works and the process of their creation, devising, development or discovery to the
                   client which are in its possession, custody or power;

       14.3.3      not apply for any Client IPR unless requested to do so by the Client;

       14.3.4      apply, or join with or assist the Client in applying, for Client IPR in the United
                   Kingdom and in any other part of the world; and

       14.3.5      do all acts necessary to ensure that absolute title in all rights in the Client IPR has
                   passed, or will pass, to the Client,

       14.3.6      and confirms that the Consultancy Personnel has given (and undertakes that any
                   Substitute will give) written undertakings in equivalent terms to the Consultancy.

14.4   The Consultancy warrants that:

       14.4.1      it has not given and will not give permission to any third party to use any of the
                   Works, nor any of the Client IPR;

       14.4.2      it is unaware of any use by any third party of any of the Works or Client IPR; and

       14.4.3      the use of the Works or the Client IPR by the Client will not infringe the rights of
                   any third party;

       14.4.4      and confirms that the Consultancy Personnel has given (and undertakes that any
                   Substitute will give) written undertakings in equivalent terms to the Consultancy.

14.5   The Consultancy undertakes to do all such further acts and execute (as a deed or otherwise) all
       such documents at the expense of the Agency or the Client as the Agency or the Client may
       reasonably require at any time either during or after the Term to vest in the Client (or its
       nominee) all right, title and interest that the Consultancy has agreed in this agreement is or
       should be vested in the Client (or its nominee) and for the purposes of the prosecution of, or
       any proceedings concerning (including, without limitation, the validity or infringement of), any
       Client IPR. The Consultancy confirms that the Consultancy Personnel has given (and undertakes
       that any Substitute will give) written undertakings in equivalent terms to the Consultancy.
