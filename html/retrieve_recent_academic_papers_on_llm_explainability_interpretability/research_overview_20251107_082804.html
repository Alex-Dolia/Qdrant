<p>The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed the field of natural language processing in recent years [1]. These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks such as text classification, machine translation, and question answering. However, their lack of transparency and interpretability has raised significant concerns about their reliability and trustworthiness [2].</p>
<p>The need for explainable and interpretable AI systems is increasingly recognized as a crucial step towards more trustworthy and transparent AI. LLMs, in particular, are seen as high-risk models that require careful evaluation and explanation to ensure their safe deployment in critical applications such as healthcare, finance, and education.</p>
<p>Recent years have witnessed significant advances in LLM explainability and interpretability research. Techniques such as feature attribution, saliency maps, and model-agnostic explanations have been proposed to provide insights into model decisions [3]. However, these methods often face challenges related to their reliability, scalability, and interpretability of results.</p>
<p>Our survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent research on LLM explainability and interpretability. We focus on papers published between 2020 and 2025, highlighting key trends and shifts in the field. Our goal is to facilitate further research on this topic by identifying gaps, challenges, and opportunities for future investigation.</p>
<p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the current state of LLM explainability and interpretability research, highlighting major advances and challenges.

<h2>Background / Foundations</h2>
<h3>Historical Context</h3>
<p>The field of Large Language Model (LLM) explainability/interpretability has evolved significantly over the past decade, with key milestones and developments shaping its current state. Pre-2020 foundational work laid the groundwork for understanding complex neural networks, but it was not until the widespread adoption of LLMs that the need for explainability/interpretability became increasingly pressing.</p>
<p>In the early 2010s, researchers began exploring techniques to improve the interpretability of deep neural networks (DNNs), including visualization methods and feature importance. However, these approaches were largely limited to understanding individual layers or features rather than providing a comprehensive explanation of model decisions.</p>
<p>The emergence of LLMs in the mid-2010s marked a significant shift towards more complex models that could process vast amounts of text data. Initially, these models were primarily evaluated on their performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, perplexity) without much consideration for explainability/interpretability.</p>
<h3>Fundamental Concepts</h3>
<p>Core definitions and terminology are essential to understanding the field of LLM explainability/interpretability. Key concepts include:</p>
<p>* <strong>Explainability</strong>: The ability to provide insights into a model's decision-making process, often through visualization or feature attribution.
* <strong>Interpretability</strong>: The capacity to understand why a model makes specific predictions or decisions, typically involving human-interpretable representations.
* <strong>Transparency</strong>: The property of models being easily understandable and explainable.</p>
<h3>Foundational Methods</h3>
<p>Early approaches to LLM explainability/interpretability drew from existing work in visualization, feature importance, and saliency maps. Some pioneering techniques include:</p>
<p>* <strong>Layer-wise relevance propagation</strong> (LRP) [1]: A method for assigning relevance scores to input features based on a model's predictions.
* <strong>DeepLIFT</strong> [2]: An algorithm that assigns contribution scores to specific input features.</p>
<h3>Theoretical Framework</h3>
<p>The theoretical foundations of LLM explainability/interpretability are rooted in several key areas:</p>
<p>* <strong>Attention mechanisms</strong>: These enable models to selectively focus on relevant parts of the input, providing insights into their decision-making process.
* <strong>Activation functions</strong>: Non-linear activation functions like ReLU and Sigmoid introduce complexity, making it more challenging to understand model behavior.</p>
<h3>Problem Formulation</h3>
<p>The problem of LLM explainability/interpretability is typically formulated as follows:</p>
<p>* <strong>Input</strong>: A large corpus of text data
* <strong>Output</strong>: A set of predictions or decisions made by the LLM
* <strong>Evaluation criteria</strong>: Metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and interpretability metrics (e.g., feature importance, saliency maps)</p>
<h3>Foundational Applications</h3>
<p>Early use cases for LLM explainability/interpretability include:</p>
<p>* <strong>Text classification</strong>: Initial applications focused on understanding model decisions in text categorization tasks.
* <strong>Sentiment analysis</strong>: Researchers explored how to provide insights into models' ability to identify sentiment and emotions.</p>
<p>By grounding the current state of LLM explainability/interpretability within its historical context, fundamental concepts, foundational methods, theoretical framework, problem formulation, and applications, we can better understand the complexities and challenges involved in this rapidly evolving field. As we proceed with our taxonomy, we will explore how recent advances have addressed these challenges and what future directions hold promise for improving LLM explainability/interpretability.</p>
